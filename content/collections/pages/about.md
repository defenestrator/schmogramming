I started writing computer code in late 1983, on an Atari 800XL. My first language was English, my next was Atari BASIC. I have learned almost nothing since then, as you will see.

I care about people a lot more than I care about money.

I'm middle aged, but it often feels like the software market wants me to understand how I'm ancient and probably useless. I'm not a billionaire, nor even properly well-off for any 'good' programmer to be, so nobody seems to listen when I claim to be ancient and useful, *like a mild-mannered dragon*. The world in which we presently live allows little nuance, and having a rich life experience is somehow no substitute for earning a bunch of money. It seems I'm largely unhirable, for whatever reason, and I've more or less given up on that.

### I'm here to make sense

Don't get it twisted.
